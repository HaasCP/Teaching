# Teaching

**Most people can simply download the library using Code -> "Download ZIP", extract the files and open the HTML files in the `notebooks/` folder**—no setup or installations required.

A lightweight, reusable scaffold for teaching materials—Jupyter notebooks and supporting docs—organized for workshops or university courses.
