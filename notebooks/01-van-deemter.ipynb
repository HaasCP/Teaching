    "# Van Deemter in Practice: An Interactive Exploration of Chromatographic Efficiency, Flow Rate, and Particle Size\n",
    "\n",
    "Christian P. Haas, September 2025\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook turns the van Deemter equation into a hands-on playground. You’ll build intuition for how eddy diffusion (*A*), longitudinal diffusion (*B/u*), and mass transfer (*C·u*) shape plate height *H* as a function of flow rate *u*—and translate that into practical method-design choices for LC (and GC, where noted).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end, you will be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Interpret the *A*, *B/u*, and *C·u* terms and explain how each dominates in different *u*-regimes.\n",
    "* Identify the optimal flow rate *u*<sub>opt</sub> and corresponding *H*<sub>min</sub>, and relate *H* to plate number (*N = L/H*) and resolution (*R*<sub>s</sub>).\n",
    "* Compare particle **size** effects on *A* and *C*, and reason about trade-offs among speed, resolution, and pressure limits.\n",
    "* Make design decisions (e.g., choose *u*, *L*, and particle size) under realistic constraints such as pressure and extra-column broadening.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Audience & Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Who:** Students and practitioners in analytical chemistry, chromatography, or method development.\n",
    "* **No coding required:** Minimal Python familiarity helps only if you modify the content of the notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Estimated time:** 25–40 minutes.\n",
    "**Scope:** LC throughout, with GC notes where diffusion/viscosity dominate differently.\n",

    "- **Selectivity** *(how different the analytes interact with the column)* — determines **how far apart** the **peak centers** elute (retention/relative retention, often written as $\\alpha$).  \n",
    "- **Efficiency** *(band broadening, how much each band spreads while traveling)* — determines **how wide** each **peak** becomes (linked to plate height $H$; narrower peaks = better).\n",
    "\n",
    "In the sketch below, each column shows two colored bands moving through a column. From left to right, separation improves because either the **selectivity increases** (centers farther apart) and/or the **efficiency** increases (band broadening decreases, peaks narrower). In this notebook we’ll **hold the idea of selectivity in the background** and focus on the second lever: **band broadening** and how the **van Deemter equation** explains it.\n",
