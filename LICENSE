This repository is released as Open Educational Resources (OER) under a dual-license scheme:

* Textual content and figures: Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0)
* Source code (scripts, helper modules, and code cells in notebooks): MIT License

This split lets educators freely remix the learning materials while keeping the code maximally reusable.

1. SCOPE AND FILE MAPPING

* "Content" (CC BY 4.0): Markdown cells in notebooks, explanatory text, diagrams and figures (including plots generated by the notebooks), syllabus fragments, and documentation under /docs, /figures, and narrative text embedded in /notebooks.
* "Code" (MIT): Python (or other) source files, helper utilities, and code cells inside notebooks; environment files under /env and /binder; small utility scripts.

Notebook convention: Unless a cell explicitly states otherwise, Markdown cells and rendered figures are CC BY 4.0, and code cells are MIT.

Data: Files in /data must be small and openly redistributable. If a dataset carries its own license, that license overrides the default for that dataset. Document dataset licenses in /data/README.md.
